## Touring-by CMS and API
Touring-by is a personal project built as part of my thesis.
The project is about helping people explore an area or a location by proposing them routes of interesting points.
### CMS
This repo includes the CMS of the app, at which an administrator can create, update or delete locations, point or routes.
### API
This repo also includes the API which respondes to end-users requests. 
#### Built with:
1. Laravel
2. Bootstrap 4
3. Google Maps JS Api (needs a key to work properly)
#### Deployed on
